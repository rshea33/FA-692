2020-08-05 01:17:32+00:00|@TrevorMahlmann @arstechnica V1.1 legs will be ~60% longer. V2.0 legs will be much wider &amp; taller ‚Äî like Falcon, but capable of landing on unimproved surfaces &amp; auto-leveling.

2020-08-05 00:29:46+00:00|@SciGuySpace Exactly

2020-08-04 23:54:18+00:00|@TrevorMahlmann Possible flight in 3 mins
2020-08-04 18:04:40+00:00|@Erdayastronaut Most likely
2020-08-04 07:41:11+00:00|@flcnhvy @Lindw0rm @cleantechnica True
2020-08-04 07:13:46+00:00|@Lindw0rm @cleantechnica Highly likely down the road
2020-08-04 07:10:32+00:00|@cleantechnica True fact
2020-08-04 00:44:42+00:00|@NASASpaceflight Scrubbed for the day. A Raptor turbopump spin start valve didn‚Äôt open, triggering an automatic abort. We‚Äôll figure out why &amp; retry tomorrow.
2020-08-03 23:23:00+00:00|@Erdayastronaut I‚Äôm in the Boca control room. Hop attempt in ~33 minutes.
2020-08-03 15:51:42+00:00|@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX For sure

2020-08-03 15:48:31+00:00|@engineers_feed Pretty much

2020-08-02 05:43:55+00:00|@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX However, we did prove that a SuperDraco landing could work by doing a propulsive hover https://t.co/Mr7VFIQwWf
2020-08-02 05:42:00+00:00|@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX All correct. Parachutes were originally the backup landing system, with SuperDraco thrusters as primary. Difficulty of proving thruster landing safety *and* architecture being suboptimal for moon/Mars caused us to change focus to parachutes.
